# youtube-virality-app
A python application that takes YouTube data and predicts whether videos will go viral. 

This interactive web app predicts whether a YouTube video is likely to go viral — based on early engagement patterns and video metadata. Built with logistic regression and trained on real YouTube trending data, it allows users to explore how variables like like ratio, comment activity, publish time, and video category influence a video's chances of reaching 1,000,000+ views.

The model was trained on a subset of videos that were just below the virality threshold (500K–800K views), and labeled as viral if they eventually crossed 1 million views.
